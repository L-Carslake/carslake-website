A group masters project to design and build an RF direction of arrival estimation system using a linear antenna array. The device is capable of receiving signals over a range of 50MHz - 1GHz and through the use of DSP the direction of the transmitter can be calculated. The algorithm selected is Capon beamforming implemented on an Xilinx FPGA. My focus in this project is the analogue-digital interface and FPGA implementation of beamforming algorithms.
