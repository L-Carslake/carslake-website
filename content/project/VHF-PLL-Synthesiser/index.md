A project into the design, simulation and testing of a 200MHz synthesized oscillator. This design makes use of systems such as a PLL with a common-base Colpitts oscillator and 10MHz crystal oscillator. It has been undertaken as part of the 2nd Year undergraduate labs, with the aim of developing RF design skills. As an outcome of this, we have successfully built a circuit that can synthesise frequencies between 195-205MHz at powers greater than -10dBm, with a minimum step size of 100KHz.
