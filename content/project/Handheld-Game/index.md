After seeing a video on the disassembly of a 1980s childâ€™s game, similar to the popular lane splitter genre of app. I was inspired to recreate my version using technology that was available during that era. By using only discrete logic, this project provided a greater insight into the design process compared to using a microcontroller. Breaking my design down into systems, the gameplay was created using a PRNG and multiple shift registers and a scoring system used a counter and seven segment decoder. The PCB was designed in Kicad and the schematic can be seen here.
