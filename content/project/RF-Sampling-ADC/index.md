Software-defined radio is a design of radio transceivers where components traditionally in the analogue domain are moved to the software domain proving increased flexibility and reusability. Achieving the ideal SDR receiver requires high speed and power efficient ADCs, in this work, time interleaving two 200MSPS 8bit ADCs and subsequent digital signal processing is discussed as a solution to receiving FM radio broadcasts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the design, measurement of signal to noise ratio, ADC mismatches and received signal integrity are discussed.
