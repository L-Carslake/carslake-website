My most recent project is to develop NPL's capability in Rydberg sensor systems. The goal for this system is develop wideband self calibrated E-field measurement capability based on quantum effects. This is expected to improve the measurement uncertainty for this measurement service 10x. Additionally, there are many applications including remote sensing, ultra-sensitive receivers and integrated demodulation functions possible for future work when these sensors are established.
