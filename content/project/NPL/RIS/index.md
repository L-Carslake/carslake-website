Design, manufacture and testing of a 1.5 bit RIS system operating at 3.7 GHz for 5G communications. NPL have successfully completed real-world field trials of its patented Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology on a commercial 5G base station at BT’s Research Centre at Adastral Park. This cutting-edge RIS technology, designed and manufactured at NPL, has demonstrated remarkable performance that promises to revolutionise the telecommunications industry.
