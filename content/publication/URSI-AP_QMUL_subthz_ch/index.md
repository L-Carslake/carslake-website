Abstract: This paper presents a novel VNA-based THz channel sounding measurement setup that incorporates phase compensation, leveraging both power-adjustable radio-over-fiber (RoF) technology and a dedicated phase compensation mechanism for the 330–500 GHz range. The performance of system has been evaluated through a link budget analysis with optical fiber lengths of up to 600 m in a dense lab environment, along with radio channel sounding assessments at distances of up to 5.61 m.
