Abstract: This paper presents a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)-based phase-compensated channel sounder, operating in the 330–500 GHz frequency range, utilizing radio-over-fiber (RoF) technology to support long-range phase-coherent measurements. A novel phase compensation scheme is introduced to mitigate phase variations caused by optical fiber, enabling its use in multi-channel and long-range measurements. The system's performance is validated in a line-of-sight (LOS) indoor lab environment. Additionally, a link budget analysis with optical fiber lengths of up to 600 m and preliminary indoor radio channel sounding assessments have been conducted to evaluate the sounder's functionality.
