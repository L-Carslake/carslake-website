Abstract: The sub-THz frequency has sparked significant interest in characterizing wireless radio propagation channels beyond 5G communications. However, there is limited research and experimental verification on wide bandwidth propagation channel characteristics in the open literature. This study focuses on modeling and simulating indoor channel scenarios within the 500 GHz– 750 GHz subterahertz (sub-THz) frequency band to enhance our understanding of these frequencies’ channel characteristics. We validated the simulation platform’s accuracy by comparing its results with measured data, confirming its reliability. Using directional horn antennas, we investigated obstructed and unobstructed indoor environments to understand channel behavior at varying distances between transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) antennas within the 500 GHz–750 GHz frequency band. This work establishes a strong foundation for further research and applications, significantly contributing to our understanding of propagation characteristics in indoor channels within this frequency range.
